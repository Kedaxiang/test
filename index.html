                                              <p>
                                               Dear my love                                               
                                              </p>

                                              <p>
                                               i feel in my heart and in my soul each thing that you say to me. it is something amazing 
                                               because i think that you always know when i am sad, when i am very happy or when i 
                                               think of you more than i usually do. your words show me how much you understand me 
                                               you love me and how much we are connected to each other even with the distance between
                                               us, i realize each time more that we were born to each other.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                              when i met you for the first time, there was a day that i thought i would forget you forever,
                                              but i was wrong because i have still got your face painted on my heart, on my soul, and in 
                                              my memory. the first time i kissed you, much time has passed, but i still have your kiss 
                                              burning on my lips and your cologne in all my senses. 
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                              maybe i dream too much but when i think of you i long to feel your touch, to whisper in your
                                              ears words that only you would hear if only you were mine. there is love so deep inside of me, 
                                              my love, and in every part of me there is a part of you. you are everywhere i am and be sure
                                              that i will be standing by your side praying that you will always have a beautiful life.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                             like a star, you are already the star of my life, my sky, and my ocean. i will always need you because
                                             i cannot live without air, without water and without my soul, and you are all this for me. i love 
                                             you and forever i love you. my body is still wanting to feel you and your hug and i will pray that
                                             this day won't come so late, but if it comes late, even this way i will be here for you and only for you. 
                                            all my kisses to you my love, and dream of me... from a girl lost in love for you.
